```

### 2. Missing Model Imports (Priority 1)
```python
# Several views reference models that need proper imports:

# Fix imports in views.py files:
from src.products.models import Product, Brand, Category  # âœ… Already done
from src.assets.models import Asset, AssetCategory        # âœ… Already done  
from src.feeds.models import DataFeed, FeedGeneration     # âœ… Already done
from src.audit.models import AuditLog, ModelSnapshot     # âœ… Already done
from django.db.models import Max                         # Add this
```

### 3. Settings Configuration (Priority 1)
```python
# src/solidus/settings.py needs these additions:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... existing apps
    'src.core',          # âœ… Already configured
    'src.products',      # âœ… Already configured  
    'src.assets',        # âœ… Already configured
    'src.feeds',         # âœ… Already configured
    'src.accounts',      # âœ… Already configured
    'src.audit',         # âœ… Already configured
    'src.api',           # ADD THIS
]

# WebSocket configuration for notifications
ASGI_APPLICATION = 'solidus.asgi.application'

# Channel layers for real-time features
CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'channels_redis.core.RedisChannelLayer',
        'CONFIG': {
            'hosts': [('127.0.0.1', 6379)],
        },
    },
}

# File upload settings
FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE = 100 * 1024 * 1024  # 100MB
DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE = 100 * 1024 * 1024   # 100MB
```

### 4. Database Setup (Priority 1)
```bash
# Run these commands to set up the database:
python manage.py makemigrations accounts
python manage.py makemigrations core  
python manage.py makemigrations products
python manage.py makemigrations assets
python manage.py makemigrations feeds
python manage.py makemigrations audit
python manage.py migrate

# Load initial data
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/initial_data.json
python manage.py create_dev_data --reset
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## ðŸ”§ Quick Fixes Needed (Priority 2)

### Fix Template References
```python
# Some views reference templates with different names than implemented:
# Update these in the view files:

# In assets/views.py:
template_name = 'assets/browse.html'  # âœ… Already matches

# In products/views.py:  
template_name = 'products/list.html'  # âœ… Already matches

# In feeds/views.py:
template_name = 'feeds/my_feeds.html' # âœ… Already matches
```

### Add Missing Static Files
```bash
# Add these to staticfiles collection:
static/
â”œâ”€â”€ css/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ custom.css         # Custom styles beyond Tailwind
â”œâ”€â”€ js/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ htmx-extensions.js # HTMX custom extensions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ notifications.js   # Real-time notifications
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils.js           # Utility functions
â””â”€â”€ images/
    â”œâ”€â”€ logo.png           # Company logo
    â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.ico        # Site favicon  
    â””â”€â”€ placeholder.png    # Image placeholder
```

## ðŸš€ Getting Started Commands

### 1. Development Setup

# Start development server
make dev
```

### 2. Docker Setup  
```bash
# Build and start containers
make build
make up

# Setup database in containers
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
docker-compose exec web python manage.py create_dev_data

# View logs
make logs
```

### 3. Access the Application
```
# Development URLs:
- Main app: http://localhost:8000
- Admin: http://localhost:8000/admin
- API docs: http://localhost:8000/api/docs/

# Login credentials (from dev data):
- Admin: admin/admin123
- Employee: employee/employee123  
- Customer: customer1/customer123
```
